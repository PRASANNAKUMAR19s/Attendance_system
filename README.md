Automated Student Attendance Monitoring System using **Face Recognition (LBPH + Deep Learning)**, **OpenCV**, **AI Analytics**, **REST API**, **Firebase**, **Docker**, and a modern web portal.

The system automatically detects and recognizes student faces in real time, records attendance, performs behavior analysis, identifies attendance irregularities, generates reports, and sends real-time SMS/Email notifications to parents and faculty members.

---

# **Objectives**

- Automate student attendance using robust face recognition (LBPH + deep learning).
- Support partial-face recognition (masks, occlusion) using landmark heuristics and model-based embeddings.
- Detect and manage late comers automatically, with tutor/HOD workflows for verification.
- Provide real-time SMS/Email notifications to parents, tutors and administrative staff.
- Generate daily attendance reports (PDF/CSV) and analytics dashboards; persist data to Firebase when enabled.


# **Modules**

- Face Recognition Module (LBPH + optional Deep Learning)
- Partial Face Recognition Module (eyes / nose / facial geometry heuristics)
- Attendance Marking Module (ON_TIME / LATE / PRESENT_PARTIAL / ABSENT)
- Late Comer Detection Module
- Notification Module (Email + SMS gateway, e.g., Twilio)
- Report Generation Module (PDF / charts / CSV)
- REST API & Web Portal (Tutor / Student views)
- Firebase Integration (optional)


# **Proposed System / Flow**

Classroom webcam → Face detection & recognition (LBPH / DL) → If full match, mark ON_TIME/PRESENT; if partial landmarks detected, mark PRESENT_PARTIAL → If detected after grace period mark LATE → Missing detections after period end marked ABSENT (auto) → Notification Module sends SMS/Email to Parents / Tutor / HOD → Reports archived in `attendance/` and `reports/`, optionally synced to Firebase.


# **Advantages**

- Real-Time Parent Notification
- Late Comer Monitoring and Management
- Partial Face Recognition Support (masks/occlusion)
- Improved Attendance Security and Audit Trail
- Automated Reports and Analytics


# **PPT Features (for slide updates)**

- Slide 6 (Modules): Add Notification Module, Late Comer Detection Module, Partial Face Recognition Module
- Slide 7 (System Architecture): Add SMS Gateway, Email Notification Module, Late Comer Detection, Partial Face Recognition
- Slide 12 (Advantages): Add Real-Time Parent Notification; Late Comer Monitoring; Partial Face Recognition Support; Improved Attendance Security


# **Results**

- The system produces daily Present / Absent / Late lists and generates defaulter reports.
- Notifications are sent automatically for Present, Absent, and Late events.
- Partial recognitions are recorded as `PRESENT_PARTIAL` and included in reports and analytics.
- Data and reports are available in `attendance/` and `reports/`, and can be synced to Firebase when enabled.

# 🤖 AI-Based Student Behavior Analysis

The system continuously monitors student attendance behavior and classroom activity patterns using AI-based analytics.

### Features
- Continuous absence detection
- Late comer frequency monitoring
- Attendance irregularity tracking
- Student activity analysis
- Attendance trend monitoring
- Classroom behavior observation

### High Priority Alert System

If a student remains absent for a long duration and suddenly attends class again, the system automatically generates a HIGH ALERT notification.

The alert is sent to:
- Tutor
- HOD
- Attendance Management Staff

### Example Alert
"Warning: Student attendance irregularity detected. Immediate academic monitoring recommended."

---

# 📩 Smart Attendance Notification System

The system automatically sends:
- Present notifications
- Absent notifications
- OD updates
- Late comer alerts
- Attendance irregularity alerts

### Notification Recipients
- Parents
- Tutor
- HOD
- Attendance Management Staff

---

## ✅ Present Student Notification

When a student is detected through the webcam and attendance is marked successfully, an automatic notification is sent.

### Example
"Your son/daughter is present in today’s class."

---

## ✅ Absent Student Notification

If a student is not detected during attendance monitoring, the system automatically sends absence notifications to:
- Parents
- Tutor
- HOD
- Attendance Management Staff

---

## ✅ OD (On Duty) Monitoring

The system verifies approved OD students separately and updates attendance records automatically to avoid incorrect absence marking.

---

## ✅ Late Comer Detection & Alert

The system identifies students entering the classroom after the scheduled class start time.

Late comer notifications are automatically sent to:
- Parents
- Tutor
- HOD
- Attendance Management Staff

---

# 📄 Automated Attendance Report Sharing

After attendance completion, the system automatically generates attendance reports and shares them through:
- SMS
- Email
- Digital Dashboard

### Sample Attendance Report

```text
Class : AI&DS
Date : 07/01/2026
Session : Forenoon

Total No. of Students : 58
No. of Present Students : 52
No. of Absentees : 6

09. Brammavathi
18. Imayavarman
19. Jaiprakash
40. Pavithra P
49. Sanjay Aditya
54. Sriananya

No. of OD Students : 2

51. Shriram
55. Sridhar

Late Comer List : Automatically Generated
```

---

# 📊 Attendance Analytics

The system provides:
- Attendance percentage calculation
- Present/Absent analysis
- Late comer analysis
- Attendance dashboard visualization
- CSV data storage
- Graphical report generation
- Attendance trend analysis
- Student behavior reports
- Attendance prediction analytics
- Risk student identification

---

# 🚀 Quick Start

## 1. Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PRASANNAKUMAR19s/Attendance_system.git
cd Attendance_system
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
```

---

## 2. Run the Web App

```bash
python app.py
```

Open:
```text
http://localhost:5000
```

### Portal Login

- Tutor / HOD / admin users sign in with the normal portal login.
- Student users can sign in with their register number as both the username and password for the current demo workflow.
- After login, the app redirects automatically to the correct dashboard for that role.

### Automatic Web Workflow

Once the app is open, the main attendance flow happens from the web pages:

1. Log in as tutor, HOD, admin, or student.
2. Open the dashboard for the role.
3. Capture or review attendance records.
4. Automatically mark present, late, absent, or partial-face cases.
5. Send SMS/Email notifications when attendance events are recorded.
6. Generate reports, summaries, and defaulter lists from the portal.

The web portal is the day-to-day control center for attendance operations. Dataset collection and model training remain separate setup tasks.

## 3. Face Recognition Pipeline

Use these only for initial setup, dataset creation, or retraining:

```bash
python 1_dataset_collector.py
python 2_train_model.py
python 3_face_recognition.py
python 4_attendance_report.py
```
